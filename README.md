# Healthcare_Analytics

## Overview

This project aims to analyze heart disease data using machine learning techniques. Data from multiple sources, including CDC, Kaggle, and CMS, was collected, preprocessed, and integrated. The project explores key risk factors such as smoking, diabetes, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels to find data-driven conclusions for mitigating heart disease.

## Usage

1. Data Preparation: Unzip all data files in 'data' folder.
2. Execution order:

* run 'dbinsert.ipynb'
* then 'preprocessing.ipynb'
* then 'analysis.ipynb'
* finally 'DecisionTree.ipynb'

## Required Libraries

* CSV
* mysql
* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* sklearn
* scipy

## Motivation

The project is motivated by the critical need to understand and address the challenges and causes of heart disease. By analyzing diverse datasets and employing machine learning techniques, the objective is to identify influential risk factors associated with heart conditions.

## Objectives

1. Data Exploration: conduct deep analysis of datasets
2. Risk Factor Identification: Identify key factors impacting heart disease
3. Machine Learning Modeling: Develop predictive models for heart diesease.
